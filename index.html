        <h3>MY HOPE IN FUTURE</h3>
        <h4 class="orange-hilight">2021 - Future | Pro Level Web Dev</h4>
        <p>Web developers have expertise in object-oriented programming, 
            multiplatform development, and the building of web applications. 
            They blend creative vision with project management skills to plan,
             design and build websites and integrated applications</p>

<h3>why i focus on as a new web developer</h3>
<h4 class="orange-hilight">2020 - Present | I am learing</h4>
<p>To me, what really matters as a new web developer is 
    one thing: learning how to build things 
    that work. ... Yes, you will also need to develop
     the ability to build well-written,
     easy-to-maintain software; but it would be irresponsible 
    to require a junior developer to have these skills.</p>
